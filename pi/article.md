## The mental model

pi is two things with a clean seam between them: a **model-agnostic agent
loop library** (`@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`) that knows nothing about
terminals, and a **terminal coding application** that configures one `Agent`
instance per session and renders its event stream.[^1] The loop doesn't know
what a tool *does* — it only knows the protocol: look up, validate,
`beforeToolCall`, execute, `afterToolCall`, append the result.[^2] Everything
pi-specific (system prompt sections, the 4 default tools, the TUI) lives
above that seam.[^3]

The governing tradeoff: pi keeps the core tiny and pushes *policy* to the
edges. Anything opinionated — approvals, planning, memory, iteration caps —
is an extension's job or doesn't exist at all. You get a small, stable core
with a large extension surface; you pay by assembling your own policy layer.
If you're building a harness, that's pi's thesis in one sentence: mechanism
in the core, policy in extensions.

## Package map

The repo is a monorepo. For this article only three packages matter:[^4]

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `packages/agent` | The loop: `Agent` class + `runAgentLoop`/`runAgentLoopContinue` + event types |
| `packages/ai` | Model providers (~42) behind one `StreamFn` signature |
| `packages/coding-agent` | The app: `AgentSession`, system prompt, tools, TUI/RPC/print modes |

Everything else (`mcp`, `server`, `tui`, `durable`, `evals`, …) is out of
scope for the core trace.

## The core loop

`runAgentLoop()` and `runAgentLoopContinue()` both delegate to a shared
`runLoop()`.[^5] Two nested loops:

- **Inner loop** — runs while tool calls or steering messages remain. Each
  iteration: append pending messages → `prepareRequest` (may swap
  context/model/reasoning) → `transformContext` (extension hooks) →
  `convertToLlm` → provider streaming call → parse response → execute tool
  calls → append results.[^6]
- **Outer loop** — after the agent would otherwise stop, drains follow-up
  messages.[^6]

The loop is **event-sourced**: every state change emits a typed `AgentEvent`
(`agent_start/end`, `turn_start/end`, `message_start/update/end`,
`tool_execution_start/update/end`).[^7] The `Agent` class reduces these into
its state and forwards them to subscribers.[^8] The TUI, the RPC server, and
print mode are all just subscribers — there is no privileged renderer.[^9]

**The most interesting negative finding:** there is no max-iteration,
max-step, or max-turn limit anywhere in the loop or the session layer.[^10]
A runaway loop is stopped by the model ceasing to emit tool calls, every
tool result in a batch setting `terminate: true`, a `finishTurn` hook, or the user
hitting Ctrl+C (`AbortController`).[^11] pi trusts the model's stop behavior
the way a REPL trusts EOF.

That's a deliberate trust model, not an oversight — and it's the kind of
decision to steal or reject consciously. Anyone who wants a cap can add one
in a `finishTurn` hook without forking the loop, so the core never has to
know what "too many iterations" means for your deployment.[^11] The price is
real: a misbehaving model burns tokens until the user aborts. pi's bet is
that a policy-free core stays small and stable while the ecosystem sorts out
policy — the same bet as the approval story below.

## One turn, end to end

Trace: the user types `help me refactor foo.ts` in interactive mode.

**① Input.** `AgentSession.prompt()` first gives extension slash commands
a chance to handle the text, then lets extensions intercept via `input`
handlers, then expands skill commands and prompt templates.[^12] If the
agent is already streaming, the message is queued through `steer()`
(interrupt) or `followUp()` (wait) instead of starting a new run — the
caller must say which, or `prompt()` throws.[^13] Only on the non-streaming
path does it validate the model and auth (OAuth/API key) and run a
pre-prompt compaction check.[^12][^30]

**② Prompt assembly.** Before every agent start, extensions may edit the
system-prompt options.[^14] `_preparePromptAndToolLoadout` then diffs the
*structured* system prompt — sections named `preamble`, `tools`, `rules`,
and `docs` (the last three only when pi's default prompt is in use), plus
`addendum`, `project_context`, `skills`, `cwd`, and any custom sections —
against the transcript's
current sections, and emits only the changed ones (a `null` removes a
section).[^15][^16] Non-preamble sections are wrapped in XML tags of the
same name so the model can match later updates to them.[^16] Tool
declarations ride along as `toolsAdded`/`toolsRemoved` deltas on the system
message, keeping the provider-visible tool list reconciled with the runtime
registry.[^17]

The tradeoff here is token economics versus protocol complexity. Resending
only changed sections keeps long sessions cheap — the model never re-reads
a prompt it already has — but it means the system message is a small
versioned protocol (sections, `null` removals, tool deltas) that every
provider adapter must replay faithfully.[^15][^16] Most harnesses resend the
whole prompt and eat the tokens; pi chose the complex, cheap path.

**③ Model call.** `Agent.prompt()` → `runAgentLoop()` → the app's `streamFn`,
which delegates to `modelRuntime.streamSimple()` — token streaming from
whichever of ~42 providers is selected.[^18] Per-request hooks (`onPayload`,
`onResponse`) feed extension observers; the same `streamFn` also starts a
prompt-cache warmer for session requests.[^19]

**④ Response parsing.** Streaming events assemble the partial assistant
message in context. Tool calls are extracted from assistant content blocks.[^20]
Edge case worth noting: if the model stops because of output length, tool
calls are **not** executed — each receives an error result, because the
arguments may have been truncated.[^21]

**⑤ Tool dispatch.** Sequential or parallel.[^22] Per call: tool lookup →
argument preparation → schema validation (TypeBox) → `beforeToolCall` →
execute → `afterToolCall`.[^22] `beforeToolCall` can block the call and mark
the turn for termination.[^23] In the coding app this hook is wired to
extension `tool_call` handlers — there is no built-in per-command approval
prompt.[^24]

Same mechanism/policy split as the iteration cap. The core never blocks on
a human, so scripted and headless runs can never hang on a prompt — but
every deployment that wants gating must build it as an extension. If your
threat model needs approvals, pi gives you the hook, not the feature; budget
accordingly.

**⑥ Feedback.** Each result becomes a `toolResult` message appended to the
transcript; the inner loop issues the next provider request.[^25]

**⑦ Termination.** The turn ends when no tool calls, steering, or follow-ups
remain, `finishTurn` says stop, every result in a batch set `terminate`, or
an error/abort occurs.[^11] Post-loop, the session runs auto-retry for
retryable errors, a compaction check, and the `agent_before_settle`
extension boundary before finally settling.[^26]

**⑧ Rendering.** The interactive TUI subscribes to the session's event
stream and renders tokens, tool executions, and results purely from events.
Same stream feeds RPC and print/JSON modes.[^9]

The tradeoff of event-sourcing the UI: any interface can render the same
run without the loop knowing it exists — but the event schema becomes the
de-facto API contract. Adding a new event type is a versioning decision,
not an implementation detail.

## Subsystem inventory

- **Tools.** 8 built-ins: `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write` are active by
  default; `powershell`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls` ship disabled and can be
  switched on.[^27] Schema-validated,
  with per-tool system-prompt contributions (a one-line snippet + guideline
  bullets that flow into the prompt's `tools` and `rules` sections).[^27]
  Extensions register more through the same registry; tools can invoke
  other tools via `ctx.executeTool()` (nested tool calls re-enter the
  pipeline with the session's hooks).[^28]
- **Providers.** ~42 providers under `packages/ai/src/providers/` (Anthropic,
  OpenAI, Google, Bedrock, OpenRouter, xAI, …). The loop sees exactly one
  function signature; API keys resolve per request (supports expiring
  credentials); thinking levels/budgets are forwarded opaquely.[^29]
- **Sessions.** JSONL files under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`. Compaction lives
  in `core/compaction/` with branch summarization; a compaction check runs
  before and after each prompt.[^30]
- **Extensibility.** TypeScript extensions with hooks at every seam (see
  [Extension points](#extension-points) below).[^31]

## Extension points

pi's minimalism is load-bearing: the core stays small because nearly
everything plugs in somewhere.

- **Extensions** (stable API). TypeScript modules with hooks at every seam
  of the loop and session — `input`, `before_agent_start`, `tool_call`,
  `tool_result`, `context`, `agent_before_settle` — plus slash commands,
  themes, and prompt templates.[^31] They run in-process and can veto tool
  calls through `beforeToolCall`.[^24]
- **Custom tools.** Extensions and the SDK register tools through the same
  registry as the built-ins; a tool can call other tools via
  `ctx.executeTool()`, re-entering the pipeline with the session's
  hooks.[^28]
- **Skills.** Markdown files with frontmatter (`name`, `description`),
  loaded from the project directory, the global agent dir, or explicit
  paths — deduplicated by canonical path — and rendered into the system
  prompt's `skills` section.[^34] Invoked as `/skill:name`, expanded before
  the prompt reaches the loop.[^12]
- **MCP servers.** A bundled extension wraps each server tool as a pi
  `ToolDefinition` (named `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, labelled `server/tool`,
  parameters converted from its input schema), so its calls run through
  the same pipeline and hooks as built-ins.[^40] By default, though, MCP
  tools get `codemode` exposure: callable from codemode scripts but not
  declared to the model.[^50] The MCP client itself speaks stdio,
  streamable HTTP, or in-memory transports.[^41]
- **Plugins** (experimental). Facet-bundled packages — `session` and `tui`
  facets — built with the chord bundler and attached per durable server via
  plugin package profiles.[^35]
- **Provider transports.** The `StreamFn` abstraction streams from model APIs
  over SSE, WebSocket, or cached WebSocket
  (`Transport = "sse" | "websocket" | "websocket-cached" | "auto"`).[^36]
- **Remote session protocol.** `@earendil-works/pi-protocol`: a
  transport-neutral CBOR RPC protocol (version 8) with request/cancel
  envelopes addressed to server/session/attachment targets.[^37] The
  experimental server carries it over Unix domain sockets;[^38] a radius
  relay extends it over WebSocket beyond the local machine.[^39]

## Extension points in depth

Each axis below is a complete starting kit: what the harness does, the
exact interaction sequence, and the first file to open when you implement.
Diagrams use the same numbering as the prose steps.

### 1. Lifecycle hooks

Every prompt passes through the same hook pipeline, in a fixed order:
`input` handlers can rewrite or swallow the text before skill and template
expansion (only extension slash commands run earlier); `before_agent_start` can edit the system-prompt options and tool
selection; then the loop runs, consulting `tool_call`/`tool_result` hooks
around every tool execution; finally `agent_before_settle` gets a last word
— its handlers can force another turn — before `agent_end`.

![Hook lifecycle](figures/seq-hooks.svg)

Handlers run in-process and receive `(event, ctx)`. Several events support
cancellation (`return { cancel: true }`) — the session-switch confirmation
in `examples/extensions/confirm-destructive.ts` is the canonical
pattern.[^44]

**Start here:** copy `examples/extensions/permission-gate.ts` — it blocks
dangerous `bash` commands from a `tool_call` handler and asks the user via
`ctx.ui.select` when a UI is present.[^51] An
extension is a default-exported function taking `pi: ExtensionAPI`, dropped
in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` or your project's `.pi/extensions/`.[^42]
Subscribe with `pi.on("tool_call", handler)`; return `{ block: true }` from
a `tool_call` handler and the call never executes (`ToolCallEventResult`
also carries an optional `reason` and a `terminate` hint).[^31][^49]

### 2. Custom tools

Tools are the richest axis. Registration is one call —
`pi.registerTool({ name, description, parameters, execute })` — but what
happens next crosses four subsystems: the registry checks the tool's
*exposure* (`direct` | `model-only` | `codemode` | `deferred` | `hidden`),
which decides whether the model sees it, whether it activates on
registration, and who else may call it.[^45] Active tools are declared to
the model as `toolsAdded` deltas; when the model emits a `toolCall`, the
loop looks the tool up, validates arguments against its TypeBox schema,
runs `beforeToolCall`, executes, runs `afterToolCall`, and appends the
result.

![Custom tool lifecycle](figures/seq-tools.svg)

**Start here:** `ExtensionAPI.registerTool` in
`core/extensions/types.ts`.[^43] Model the `parameters` schema on
`bash.ts`'s TypeBox definition and the `execute(id, args, signal,
onUpdate)` signature on any built-in; set `exposure: "model-only"` if the
model should see the tool but other tools must never call it through
`ctx.executeTool()`.[^45]

### 3. Slash commands

Commands bypass the model entirely: text starting with `/` is intercepted
before prompt expansion, matched against the command registry, and its
handler runs immediately — even mid-stream.[^12] The handler receives the
raw argument string and a command context with UI primitives
(`ctx.ui.confirm/select/notify`) and messaging (`ctx.sendMessage`,
`ctx.sendUserMessage`, which can trigger a fresh turn).[^44][^46]

![Slash command dispatch](figures/seq-commands.svg)

**Start here:** `pi.registerCommand("deploy", { description, handler:
async (args, ctx) => { … } })` — see `examples/extensions/commands.ts` for
the full shape including argument completions.[^42][^43]

### 4. Skills

Skills have two injection paths, and the diagram shows both. Invoked as
`/skill:name`, the skill's markdown body (frontmatter stripped) is inlined
as a `<skill>` block ahead of the user's text. Independently, every prompt
lists the loaded skills in the system prompt's `skills` section, so the
model knows they exist before anyone invokes one — except skills marked
`disable-model-invocation`, and only when `read` or `bash` is active
(the model needs one of them to open a skill file).[^34]

![Skill injection paths](figures/seq-skills.svg)

**Start here:** a markdown file with `name:`/`description:` frontmatter in
`<project>/.pi/skills/` or `~/.pi/agent/skills/`.[^48] Keep the body
task-shaped — skills are procedures, not documentation.

### 5. MCP servers

MCP is an adapter, not a parallel tool system. Each configured server
(`command` for stdio, `url` for streamable HTTP)[^47] connects in the
background when the session starts; each of its tools is wrapped by
`createMcpToolDefinition` into a native pi `ToolDefinition` — named
`mcp__<server>__<tool>`, labelled `server/tool` in the UI, parameters
converted from the MCP input schema.[^40] Every call is dispatched, hooked,
and rendered exactly like a built-in's.

What differs is visibility. The default exposure is `codemode`: MCP tools
stay out of the model's tool declarations and are reached from codemode
scripts instead. `deferred` surfaces them on demand through `tool_search`,
and only `direct` declares them to the model up front.[^50] That is the
same mechanism/policy split again — the adapter is uniform, and how much
of a server's surface the model sees is configuration.

![MCP server lifecycle](figures/seq-mcp.svg)

**Start here:** the server entry in `mcp.json` (including its `exposure`), then
`extensions/mcp/tools.ts` if you need custom result conversion.[^40] The
MCP client itself speaks stdio, streamable HTTP, or in-memory
transports.[^41]

### 6. Plugins (experimental)

Plugins are the heavyweight axis: whole *facets* of pi — a `session` facet
and a `tui` facet — bundled with the chord bundler and attached to a
durable server via a persisted plugin-package profile.[^35] Where an
extension customizes behavior inside a running session, a plugin ships a
custom session and interface. The API is explicitly not stable; pin your pi
version.

![Plugin packaging](figures/seq-plugins.svg)

**Start here:** `experimental/plugins/package.ts` — but treat this axis as
incubating, not as a contract.

### 7. Provider transports

Below the `StreamFn` abstraction, the model runtime picks a wire transport
per request: SSE, WebSocket, cached WebSocket, or `auto`.[^36] Extension
hooks (`onPayload`, `onResponse`, `provider_stream_event`) observe the
traffic at this layer, which is also where the prompt-cache warmer
operates.[^19]

![Provider transport](figures/seq-transport.svg)

**Start here:** the `transport` setting and `ModelRuntime.streamSimple`.
If you're adding a provider, this is the seam — implement the transport,
the loop never changes.

### 8. Remote session protocol

`@earendil-works/pi-protocol` is a transport-neutral CBOR RPC protocol
(version 8): `hello`, `request`, and `cancel` envelopes addressed to
server/session/attachment targets.[^37] The experimental server carries
those frames over Unix domain sockets;[^38] the radius relay extends them
over WebSocket past the local machine.[^39] Because the protocol streams
`AgentEvent`s, a remote client renders exactly what the local TUI renders —
there is still no privileged renderer, just a longer wire.[^9]

![Remote session protocol](figures/seq-protocol.svg)

**Start here:** `packages/protocol/src/protocol.ts` for the envelopes,
`framing.ts` for the byte framing.

## Deliberate omissions

pi ships no sub-agents, no plan mode, and no per-tool approval prompts.[^32]
The first two are documented philosophy ("adapt pi to your workflows"); the
third is architectural: approval is an extension's job, implemented through
`beforeToolCall`, not a core feature.[^24] The security model is project trust
(`--approve` trusts project-local files) plus extension hooks — not
per-command gating.[^33]

The repo does ship all three as *example* extensions — `subagent/`,
`plan-mode/`, and `permission-gate.ts` — which is the thesis made
concrete: the features exist, as policy, outside the core.[^52] One caveat
to "minimal": the coding app loads MCP, `codemode`, and `tool_search` as
built-in extensions (the latter two inactive until enabled), so the *core*
is minimal while the default install is somewhat broader.[^50]

Read the omissions as the other half of the thesis: every "missing" feature
is a decision to keep the core's surface area small and let the extension
layer — or the model itself — carry the weight. Steal the pattern when your
harness needs to stay hackable; reject it when your users need guardrails
out of the box.
